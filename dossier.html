        <h1>PART I: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Token Lebnani Ltd ("TLB" or "the Platform") proposes to establish a regulated digital securities platform enabling diaspora investors to acquire ownership interests in Lebanese real estate assets through a compliant Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) framework. This dossier demonstrates that the proposed business model falls squarely within the Category 4 (Arranging Deals in Investments) framework and that the Platform maintains appropriate controls, governance structures, and risk mitigations to protect investor interests while operating in a complex cross-border environment.</p>

        <p>The Platform addresses a significant market gap: Lebanese diaspora investors seeking to maintain connection to their home country through property ownership currently lack access to regulated, secure investment vehicles that provide the transparency, governance, and enforceability they require. By structuring investments through bankruptcy-remote Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) incorporated in ADGM, TLB provides investors with the legal protections of a premier common law jurisdiction while gaining exposure to Lebanese property markets.</p>

        <h2>Key Regulatory Features</h2>
        <p>The Platform has been designed from inception to meet ADGM regulatory requirements. The key features include a strictly non-custodial architecture that ensures TLB never takes possession of client funds, a bankruptcy-remote SPV structure that protects investors from operational liabilities, a knowledge-based retail client qualification system that ensures investors understand the product before participating, and comprehensive AML/CFT controls tailored to the Lebanese jurisdiction risk profile.</p>

        <p>The Platform maintains robust capital resources including Base Capital of USD 10,000 meeting Category 4 minimum requirements, an Enforcement Litigation Reserve (ELR) of USD 300,000 Day 1 escalating to USD 575,000 over 36 months, and a Wind-Down Reserve of USD 100,000 managed by a contracted Standby Servicer.</p>

        <h2>Platform Value Proposition</h2>
        <p>The Platform's core value proposition is "hands-free" property ownership, enabling investors to acquire real estate assets in Lebanon without the management burdens, cross-border enforcement challenges, and banking obstacles that have traditionally prevented diaspora participation. This proposition is delivered through a three-tier legal structure that combines ADGM governance with Lebanese asset ownership, ensuring investor rights are protected through multiple enforceable mechanisms.</p>

            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>CASH-FLOW REPATRIATION PROTOCOL</h4>
        <p><strong>Primary Structure: Direct USD/AED Payments</strong></p>
        <p>The Platform's cash-flow repatriation follows a strict protocol designed to avoid Lebanese retail banking channels entirely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1 — Tenant Payment Collection:</strong> Tenants remit rent in USD cash to the Facilities Management Company (FMC)</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2 — FMC Documentation:</strong> FMC counts, logs, and receipts all cash payments, maintaining complete audit trail</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3 — Licensed Exchange House Transfer:</strong> FMC deposits USD cash with licensed Lebanese exchange house (e.g., OMT, Bob Finance) for immediate wire transfer</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4 — VASP Account Crediting:</strong> Licensed exchange house executes wire transfer directly to VASP Partner's UAE corporate account</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Explicit Prohibition:</strong> No investor or platform funds will transit Lebanese retail bank accounts. All inbound property revenue will be converted and remitted via licensed exchange houses.</p>

        <p><strong>Commercial Qualification:</strong> This structure is subject to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Banque du Liban (BDL) Circular 150 compliance</li>
            <li>Lebanese Income Tax Law (Article 56) withholding requirements</li>
            <li>Applicable BDL circulars on currency conversion</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>ASSET SELECTION CRITERIA</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Properties compliant with Decree No. 11614/1969:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximum 3,000 square meters for foreign ownership</li>
                    <li>Clear title verification via Conservation Foncière</li>
                    <li>No existing encumbrances or third-party rights</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Due Diligence Requirements:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Independent Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) valuation (COBS 18.4 compliance)</li>
                    <li>Lebanese notary public title verification</li>
                    <li>Local zoning and planning compliance checks</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>LEBANESE PROPERTY TRANSFER COMPLIANCE SUMMARY</h4>
        <p>Property transfers comply with Lebanese law through the following process:</p>
        <p><strong>Notary Requirements:</strong> All property transfers must be executed through a Lebanese notary public (notaire), who verifies title authenticity, confirms no encumbrances, and ensures compliance with foreign ownership limitations under Decree No. 11614/1969.</p>
        <p><strong>Conservation Foncière Registration:</strong> Following notary execution, property transfers must be registered with the Conservation Foncière (Land Registry) to establish legal title and provide constructive notice to third parties. This registration creates the official record of ownership and protects against subsequent claims.</p>
        <p><strong>Share Pledge Registration:</strong> The SARL shares held by the ADGM SPV are pledged to investors through registration at the Lebanese Commercial Register. This registration provides constructive notice and establishes priority for investor security interests.</p>

        <h3>Section 4: Regulatory Alignment</h3>

        <h4>ADGM REQUIREMENTS ADDRESSED</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>GEN 2.3: Fit and Proper Test — Controlled functions matrix</li>
            <li>COBS 18.4: Due Diligence — Triple-lock asset vetting process</li>
            <li>Marketing Rulebook (MKT) 4.3: Marketing and disclosure — Risk disclaimers for Lebanese market</li>
            <li>Fiat-Referenced Token (FRT) Framework 2026: Technology router model only (no custody or issuance)</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>LEBANESE COMPLIANCE ACKNOWLEDGED</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Commercial Register: SARL formation requirements</li>
            <li>Tax Registration: Ministry of Finance requirements</li>
            <li>Real Estate Registration: Conservation Foncière procedures</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h3>Section 5: Capital Evidence Requirements (FSRA Conditions)</h3>
        <p>The USD 10,000 Base Capital classification is conditional on providing the following evidence with the formal application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>System Architecture Audit Report:</strong> Third-party audit confirming that the payment initiation interface is technically incapable of receiving or instructing the receipt of client funds until the smart contract validates both the expiration of the 48-hour cooling-off period and the client's final "proceed" instruction.</li>
            <li><strong>VASP Partner Agreement:</strong> Agreement explicitly confirming that the VASP Partner maintains segregated client money accounts; the VASP acts as sole recipient and custodian of client funds from payment instruction; TLB has no ability to divert or access client funds; TLB has no authority to issue payment instructions except through pre-encoded smart contracts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Regulatory Consequence:</strong> Any operational deviation from the non-custodial payment flow will be treated as holding Client Money, retroactively triggering the USD 50,000 Base Capital requirement under PRU 3.4.1(1)(b) and constituting a material license breach.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Section 6: Standby Servicer Requirement (FSRA Mandatory)</h3>
        <p>The FSRA categorically rejected self-administered wind-down. The executed Standby Servicer Agreement is a mandatory component of the formal application.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>ADGM-licensed Corporate Service Provider contracted as Standby Servicer</li>
            <li>Responsibilities: SPV administration, asset liquidation coordination, cross-border coordination, dispute resolution, regulatory reporting</li>
            <li>Activation: Automatic upon wind-down trigger event</li>
            <li>Fee Structure: Activation fee, monthly retainer, contingency budget managed within USD 100,000 Wind-Down Reserve</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The executed Standby Servicer Agreement will be submitted with the formal application.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Section 7: Non-Consolidation Opinion Requirement</h3>
        <p>The Project SPV structure relies on bankruptcy remoteness, which requires a formal Non-Consolidation Legal Opinion at the operational stage. This opinion is critical for investors and regulators. The legal team has identified appropriate counsel to provide this opinion and confirms that it will be obtained prior to first SPV formation.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Section 8: FRT Routing and Smart Contract Security</h3>

        <h4>TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE</h4>
        <p>The Platform utilizes "Accepted Fiat-Referenced Tokens" (FRTs) for dividend distributions. TLB operates strictly as a technology router, not as an FRT Issuer or Payment Service Provider. The smart contract facilitates direct transfer of FRTs from the Project SPV's segregated reserve account to the investor's verified wallet. TLB never takes possession or control of the FRTs.</p>

        <h4>HARD-CODED DESTINATION CONTROLS</h4>
        <p>The dividend distribution smart contract is deployed with strictly limited destination parameters. The contract code contains no administrative function capable of modifying fund destinations post-deployment. Funds can only be routed to two destination categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Whitelisted Investor Wallets:</strong> Only wallets that have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and are on the platform's investor whitelist</li>
            <li><strong>SPV Reserve Account:</strong> Maintained by the VASP Partner for operational liquidity</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The smart contract cannot route funds to any address outside these parameters, regardless of any administrative key holder's instructions.</p>

        <h4>MULTI-SIG ADMINISTRATIVE GOVERNANCE</h4>
        <p>Administrative control over smart contract upgrades or emergency modifications requires a three-party quorum signature:</p>

        </div>

        <p>Any upgrade or modification requires all three signatures within a 72-hour validation window. If any party does not sign within the window, the proposed modification is automatically rejected.</p>

        <h4>ANNUAL SMART CONTRACT AUDIT COMMITMENT</h4>
        <p>The Platform commits to annual third-party security audits of production tokenization smart contracts. These audits specifically verify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard-Coded Destination Controls:</strong> Confirmation that the contract cannot route funds to addresses outside permitted parameters</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Sig Governance:</strong> Verification that the 2-of-3 quorum structure functions as designed</li>
            <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Confirmation that administrative functions are properly restricted</li>
            <li><strong>Business Logic:</strong> Verification that smart contract behavior matches documented specifications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Audit reports will be provided to the FSRA upon completion and maintained as part of the ongoing compliance record.</p>

        <h1>PART III: COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK</h1>

        <h2>Document 4: Lebanon AML Framework Addendum</h2>

        <h3>1. Enhanced Source of Wealth Requirements</h3>
        <p>For investors with connections to Lebanon, enhanced source of wealth documentation is required:</p>

        <p><strong>Acceptable Documentation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Foreign employment contracts demonstrating income earned outside Lebanon</li>
            <li>Overseas property deeds or business ownership documents outside Lebanese jurisdiction</li>
            <li>Inheritance documentation with verifiable foreign assets</li>
            <li>Pension or retirement fund statements from non-Lebanese institutions</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Required Verification:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Independent verification of foreign income sources</li>
            <li>Correlation analysis between declared wealth and lifestyle indicators</li>
            <li>Confirmation that funds have resided outside Lebanon for a minimum of 180 days prior to investment</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Legacy Investor Exception:</strong> For legacy investors with generational wealth tied to Lebanese assets (e.g., inherited property sales, family business transitions), the standard 180-day residency rule may present challenges. In such cases, the Platform requires alternative enhanced verification including a forensic audit of the asset sale transaction conducted by an internationally recognized accounting firm, layered attestations from independent legal counsel in the jurisdiction of asset location, and detailed transaction documentation tracing the fund flow from original asset to investment. Legacy investor cases require MLRO sign-off before onboarding proceeds.</p>

        <h3>2. Transaction Monitoring Scenarios</h3>
        <p><strong>Red Flags Requiring Enhanced Scrutiny:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Funds routed through a third country before appearing from the VASP</li>
            <li>Multiple small payments from different origins aggregating to an investment amount</li>
            <li>Investment amounts inconsistent with declared source of wealth</li>
            <li>Funds originating directly from Lebanese retail bank accounts (PROHIBITED)</li>
            <li>Rapid movement of funds through multiple wallet addresses before reaching platform</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Response Protocol:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>All flagged transactions require manual review by MLRO</li>
            <li>Enhanced due diligence documentation must be completed before transaction processing</li>
            <li>Persistent patterns result in relationship termination</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Clear Prohibitions</h3>
        <p><strong>Explicit Prohibitions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Platform will not accept investment funds originating directly from Lebanese retail bank accounts</li>
            <li>Platform will not process transactions from wallets linked to sanctioned entities</li>
            <li>Platform will not facilitate transactions involving parties subject to UN, OFAC, or EU sanctions</li>
            <li>Platform will not execute transactions during active political or security crisis in Lebanon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. VASP Partnership — AML/CFT Compliance Integration</h3>
        <p>The VASP Partner Agreement explicitly addresses the following AML/CFT obligations:</p>
        <p><strong>Transaction Monitoring:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The VASP Partner maintains transaction monitoring systems calibrated to the Platform's AML/CFT Risk Assessment</li>
            <li>All wallet addresses are screened against sanctions lists prior to transaction processing</li>
            <li>On-chain transaction monitoring is conducted for virtual asset transfers</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Travel Rule Compliance:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The VASP Partner complies with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule requirements as applied to Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)</li>
            <li>Required originator and beneficiary information is transmitted with all transfers above the applicable threshold</li>
            <li>The VASP Partner maintains records of all transfers for the required retention period</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Reporting Obligations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The VASP Partner is responsible for filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with relevant authorities</li>
            <li>The Platform receives notification of any SAR filings involving Platform-related transactions</li>
            <li>Coordination protocols ensure consistent reporting across the transaction chain</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Document 6: Secondary Market Access Framework</h2>

        <h3>Current Position</h3>
        <p>The Platform's Category 4 license authorizes primary market issuance activities but does not permit the operation of a trading venue. Direct peer-to-peer secondary trading for Retail Clients is not permitted under the current license.</p>

        <h3>Matched Redemption Mechanism</h3>
        <p>To provide liquidity options for Retail Clients within license boundaries, the Platform operates a "Matched Redemption" mechanism permissible under ADGM Companies Regulations. Redemption requests are held in a queue and are strictly conditional upon the Platform sourcing matching liquidity from new incoming subscriptions. Upon receipt of funds from a new subscriber, the Platform utilizes the proceeds to fund the redemption of the existing investor's tokens.</p>

        <h3>Future MTF Partnership Criteria</h3>
        <p>The Platform anticipates establishing partnerships with ADGM-licensed Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) to provide broader secondary market access. Partnership criteria include:</p>
        <p><strong>Regulatory Requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>MTF must hold valid FSRA license authorizing secondary trading in Digital Securities</li>
            <li>MTF must demonstrate compliance with ADGM market conduct requirements</li>
            <li>MTF must have established operational history and regulatory track record</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Technical Compatibility:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>MTF must support ERC-1400 or equivalent token standards</li>
            <li>MTF must integrate with the Platform's investor whitelist functionality</li>
            <li>MTF must maintain appropriate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Operational Standards:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>MTF must demonstrate adequate market-making liquidity or committed liquidity providers</li>
            <li>MTF must provide transparent order book and trade execution reporting</li>
            <li>MTF must maintain regulatory reporting capabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This approach provides investors with access to established trading infrastructure without requiring the Platform to obtain separate market operator authorization.</p>

        <h1>PART IV: BUSINESS MODEL DOCUMENTATION</h1>

        <h2>Regulatory Business Plan (RBP)</h2>

        <h3>Executive Summary — Token Lebnani</h3>

        <h4>Introduction and Business Concept</h4>
        <p>Token Lebnani Ltd ("TLB" or "the Platform") proposes to establish a regulated digital securities platform enabling diaspora investors to acquire ownership interests in Lebanese real estate assets through a compliant ADGM framework. The platform addresses a significant market gap: Lebanese diaspora investors seeking to maintain connection to their home country through property ownership currently lack access to regulated, secure investment vehicles that provide the transparency, governance, and enforceability they require.</p>
        <p>The platform's core value proposition is "hands-free" property ownership—enabling investors to acquire real estate assets in Lebanon without the management burdens, cross-border enforcement challenges, and banking obstacles that have traditionally prevented diaspora participation. By structuring investments through bankruptcy-remote Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) incorporated in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), Token Lebnani provides investors with the legal protections of a premier common law jurisdiction while gaining exposure to Lebanese property markets.</p>

        <h4>Regulatory Positioning and License Scope</h4>
        <p>Token Lebnani seeks a Category 4 Financial Services Permission under the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) framework. The Category 4 license authorizes the regulated activity of "Arranging Deals in Investments," which enables TLB to facilitate primary market issuance of digital securities representing ownership in real estate assets located in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The Category 4 license scope is explicitly limited to arranging activities. TLB does not operate and is not authorized to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF), Exchange, or Custodian. This distinction is fundamental to the platform's regulatory positioning and capital structure. The Category 4 framework provides significant capital efficiency advantages compared to higher-tier licenses while enabling the platform to offer institutional-grade investment infrastructure for digital securities.</p>
        <p>Under the Private Financing Platform (PFP) framework applicable within the ADGM RegLab environment, TLB serves Retail Clients subject to the PFP retail exemption, which permits a maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering without requiring a full prospectus. This exemption enables TLB to serve the Lebanese diaspora market through appropriate knowledge-based qualification requirements and enhanced suitability and disclosure standards.</p>

        <h4>The "Bankruptcy-Remote SPV" Structural Model</h4>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates a "Bankruptcy-Remote SPV" model, meaning that each Special Purpose Vehicle incorporated in the ADGM serves as a passive holding vehicle without active operational management responsibilities, banking relationships, or operational infrastructure. The SPV's sole function is to hold legal title to the underlying property and issue digital tokens representing ownership interests to investors.</p>
        <p>This structural model provides several operational and regulatory advantages. First, the passive nature of the SPV eliminates the need for the SPV to maintain banking relationships, employ staff, or conduct operational activities in Lebanon. Second, the SPV's bankruptcy-remote structure protects investors from operational liabilities arising from property management activities. Third, the clear separation between ownership (SPV) and operations (Facilities Management Company) enables regulatory compliance in a jurisdiction where TLB does not maintain physical presence.</p>
        <p>The SPV structure is implemented through a three-tier hierarchy: the ADGM-incorporated SPV holds 100% of the shares of a Lebanese SARL (Société à Responsabilité Limitée), which in turn holds legal title to the physical property. This structure enables enforcement through the New York Convention (to which Lebanon is a signatory) while maintaining ADGM governance over the ownership structure.</p>

        <h4>Target Market and Investor Classification</h4>
        <p>Token Lebnani serves the Lebanese diaspora through a single-track qualification system for Retail Clients. The platform's target market is the Lebanese diaspora community—individuals with Lebanese nationality, heritage, or strong connection to Lebanon who reside outside the country and seek to maintain economic connection to their homeland through property ownership.</p>
        <p>The qualification system is knowledge-based rather than wealth-exclusive. Rather than requiring all investors to demonstrate High-Net-Worth status (which would exclude the majority of the target diaspora market), TLB permits retail participation subject to knowledge-based qualification requirements. This approach aligns with the PFP regulatory framework while expanding access to investors who can demonstrate requisite understanding of the investment product.</p>
        <p>Retail Clients access the platform through the PFP retail exemption, subject to a maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering and mandatory knowledge-based qualification through the Mastery Assessment. Retail Clients may invest at tiered minimum amounts in the mid-to-low five-figure USD range (specifically, USD 10,000 to USD 55,000 per asset).</p>
        <p>The Mastery Assessment is a comprehensive evaluation designed to verify that Retail Clients possess requisite understanding of the investment product, covering risk recognition, asset structure comprehension, and platform mechanics. Additionally, the Self-Declaration Protocol requires clients to acknowledge the risks of the investment in plain language, with interactive comprehension checks ensuring informed consent.</p>
        <p>Target investors are defined based on investment intent and motivation rather than demographic factors. Legacy Investors are diaspora investors seeking to maintain connection to Lebanon through property ownership, prioritizing stability and capital preservation. These investors typically possess deep familiarity with Lebanese market conditions, cultural context, and historical economic patterns, which informs their understanding of investment risks and opportunities. Passive Beneficiaries are investors seeking hands-free property exposure without management responsibilities, valuing the platform's operational infrastructure for revenue collection and distribution services.</p>

        <h1>PART V: TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK</h1>

        <h2>Proof of Concept (POC) Technical Brief</h2>

        <h3>Core Infrastructure: ERC-1400 Standard</h3>
        <p>Tokens issued through the platform are Digital Securities under ADGM law. The token itself carries uniform characteristics: it represents direct ownership interest in the SPV, carries equivalent rights regardless of investment amount or qualification pathway, and is subject to the same regulatory treatment under ADGM law.</p>
        <p>Tokens are issued using ERC-1400 or equivalent standards suitable for regulated securities. The standard enables transfer restrictions, investor whitelisting, and compliance controls embedded directly in the token contract. Before receiving tokens, investors must complete verification and be added to the platform's investor whitelist. The whitelist is maintained by the platform and updated based on verification status. Only whitelisted investors may receive tokens from primary or secondary market transactions.</p>

        <h3>Non-Custodial Model</h3>
        <p>TLB operates a strictly non-custodial model with respect to investor funds and property owner proceeds. All fund flows are processed through a UAE-licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) partner, eliminating any touchpoint between the platform's operations and the Lebanese banking infrastructure. This architecture aligns with the platform's regulatory obligation to maintain separation of client assets.</p>
        <p>The non-custodial model ensures that TLB never takes possession, control, or custody of investor funds at any stage of the transaction lifecycle. Investor funds flow from the investor to the Partner's corporate account, through the settlement ledger, to token distribution and owner distribution. TLB's sole banking relationship is a single corporate account for operational purposes.</p>

        <h2>Governance Hierarchy and Control Framework</h2>

        <h3>Three Lines of Defense Model</h3>
        <p>TLB implements the industry-standard three lines of defense model to ensure effective risk management and control.</p>

        <p><strong>First Line of Defense — Business Operations:</strong> The first line of defense comprises business functions responsible for operational activities and day-to-day risk management. These functions own and manage the risks inherent in their operations and are responsible for implementing effective controls to mitigate those risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Second Line of Defense — Compliance and Risk Management:</strong> The second line of defense comprises the compliance and risk management functions, which provide independent oversight of first-line activities. These functions are responsible for designing policies and procedures, monitoring the effectiveness of first-line controls, and providing guidance to business staff on risk and compliance matters.</p>
        <p><strong>Third Line of Defense — Internal Audit:</strong> The third line of defense comprises the internal audit function, which provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of the firm's risk management and control framework. Internal audit reviews are conducted on a risk-based schedule.</p>

        <h3>The "Triple-Lock" Binding Mechanism</h3>
        <p>The ADGM SPV's control is secured by three mechanisms:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Registered Share Pledge:</strong> Registered share pledge at Lebanese Commercial Register provides security for investors.</li>
            <li><strong>Management Services Agreement:</strong> The Management Services Agreement with TLB Ltd establishes control mechanisms and service standards.</li>
            <li><strong>ADGM-Seated Arbitration Clause:</strong> All key agreements contain binding ADGM-seated arbitration clauses, enabling dispute resolution within the ADGM framework.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This triple-lock structure ensures that investor rights are protected through multiple enforceable mechanisms.</p>

        <h1>PART VII: CLIENT FRAMEWORK</h1>

        <h2>Client Suitability Framework</h2>

        <h3>Retail Client Qualification System</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani serves Retail Clients through a comprehensive qualification system designed to ensure that investors possess requisite understanding of the investment product before committing capital. The platform's approach reflects the PFP regulatory framework and ADGM COBS requirements while acknowledging that the target Lebanese diaspora market may not possess traditional financial sophistication but may possess deep familiarity with Lebanese real estate and cultural context.</p>
        <p>The qualification system is knowledge-based rather than wealth-exclusive. Rather than requiring all investors to demonstrate High-Net-Worth status (which would exclude the majority of the target diaspora market), Token Lebnani permits participation subject to knowledge-based qualification requirements. This approach expands access to investors who can demonstrate requisite understanding of the investment product while ensuring appropriate protection for those investors who may not possess sophisticated financial backgrounds or professional investment experience.</p>
        <p>The qualification system comprises three integrated components. The Mastery Assessment verifies knowledge and understanding of the investment product. The Self-Declaration Protocol ensures informed consent through plain language risk acknowledgment. The 48-Hour Cooling-Off Period ensures considered decision-making by preventing immediate investment commitment.</p>

        <h3>Mastery Assessment Requirements</h3>
        <p>The Mastery Assessment is a comprehensive evaluation designed to verify that Retail Clients possess requisite understanding of the investment product. The assessment covers three primary domains that collectively ensure the investor has a complete understanding of the proposition they are entering into.</p>
        <p>The first domain is risk recognition, which encompasses understanding of property market risk (including the potential for capital value fluctuation and rental income variability), currency risk (particularly relevant given the Lebanese pound devaluation history and cross-border investment structure), jurisdictional risk (including the challenges of enforcing rights in a foreign jurisdiction), and liquidity risk (the possibility that investors may not be able to exit their investment when desired). Understanding these risks is essential for Retail Clients to make an informed decision about whether this investment is appropriate for their circumstances.</p>
        <p>The second domain is asset structure comprehension, which requires the investor to demonstrate understanding of the SPV ownership structure (how the tokens represent beneficial ownership in a special purpose vehicle incorporated in ADGM), token mechanics (how the tokens function as digital securities and what rights they confer), and investor rights (what entitlements the tokens provide and how those rights can be exercised). This structural understanding is essential because the platform's model differs significantly from direct property ownership, and investors must understand exactly what they are purchasing.</p>
        <p>The third domain is platform mechanics, which requires understanding of the investment process (how primary market subscriptions work and when tokens will be issued), the distribution mechanism (how rental income and other distributions will be calculated and paid), and secondary market limitations (what liquidity options are available and what restrictions apply). This operational understanding ensures that investors have realistic expectations about the investment experience.</p>

    <div id="resolution" class="dossier-section">
        <h1>PART VIII: RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK</h1>

        <h2>Resolution and Cessation (Wind-Down) Plan</h2>

        <h3>The "Standby Servicer" Model</h3>
        <p>Upon determination that wind-down is required, a pre-contracted ADGM-licensed Corporate Service Provider (CSP) assumes administrative duties of the Project SPVs. This Standby Servicer arrangement ensures that SPV administration continues uninterrupted regardless of Token Lebnani's operational status, providing continuity of corporate governance and regulatory compliance throughout the wind-down period.</p>
        <p>The Standby Servicer relationship is established prior to platform launch through a contractual arrangement that activates automatically upon wind-down trigger. This pre-positioning ensures that no gap exists between Token Lebnani's operational cessation and the assumption of SPV administration by the Standby Servicer. The Standby Servicer is selected based on demonstrated experience with SPV administration, familiarity with the ADGM regulatory framework, and capacity to assume administration on short notice.</p>

        <h3>Standby Servicer Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>The Standby Servicer maintains responsibility for four primary functions throughout the wind-down period. Corporate records and filings encompass maintaining SPV statutory registers, filing required returns with ADGM authorities, and preserving corporate documentation in accordance with regulatory requirements. Property management continuity involves coordinating with the incumbent FMC to ensure uninterrupted property operations, monitoring FMC performance during the transition period, and implementing contingency arrangements if FMC continuity is threatened.</p>
        <p>Distribution management includes processing investor distributions in accordance with SPV agreements, calculating entitlement to remaining assets, and executing distributions in a manner consistent with the priority established in the wind-down plan. Regulatory liaison encompasses responding to regulatory inquiries, filing required notifications, and coordinating with the FSRA throughout the wind-down period.</p>
