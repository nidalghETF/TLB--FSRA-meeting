        <h2>Document 1: Regulatory Business Plan (RBP)</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction and Business Concept</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani Ltd ("TLB" or "the Platform") proposes to establish a regulated digital securities platform enabling diaspora investors to acquire ownership interests in Lebanese real estate assets through a compliant ADGM framework.</p>
        <p>The platform addresses a significant market gap: Lebanese diaspora investors seeking to maintain connection to their home country through property ownership currently lack access to regulated, secure investment vehicles that provide the transparency, governance, and enforceability they require.</p>
        <p>The platform's core value proposition is "hands-free" property ownership—enabling investors to acquire real estate assets in Lebanon without the management burdens, cross-border enforcement challenges, and banking obstacles that have traditionally prevented diaspora participation.</p>
        <p>By structuring investments through bankruptcy-remote Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) incorporated in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), Token Lebnani provides investors with the legal protections of a premier common law jurisdiction while gaining exposure to Lebanese property markets. In addition to Regulatory Base Capital, Token Lebnani maintains a liquid Wind-Down Reserve equivalent to 50% of Annual Operating Expenses, representing approximately six months of operational runway.</p>
        <p>This reserve ensures that, in the event of business cessation, Token Lebnani has sufficient liquid resources to effect an orderly wind-down, complete remaining investor obligations, and discharge regulatory responsibilities.</p>
        <p>The Wind-Down Reserve is maintained in cash or highly liquid instruments accessible within standard banking timeframes, is segregated from operational accounts, and is not utilized for day-to-day business activities.</p>

        <h3>Regulatory Positioning and License Scope</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani seeks a Category 4 Financial Services Permission under the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) framework.</p>
        <p>The Category 4 license authorizes the regulated activity of "Arranging Deals in Investments," which enables TLB to facilitate primary market issuance of digital securities representing ownership in real estate assets located in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The Category 4 license scope is explicitly limited to arranging activities. TLB does not operate and is not authorized to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF), Exchange, or Custodian.</p>
        <p>This distinction is fundamental to the platform's regulatory positioning and capital structure. The Category 4 framework provides significant capital efficiency advantages compared to higher-tier licenses while enabling the platform to offer institutional-grade investment infrastructure for digital securities.</p>
        <p>Under the Private Financing Platform (PFP) framework applicable within the ADGM RegLab environment, TLB may accept Retail Clients subject to the PFP retail exemption, which permits a maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering without requiring a full prospectus.</p>
        <p>This exemption enables TLB to serve a broader investor base than platforms limited to professional clients only, subject to enhanced suitability and disclosure requirements.</p>

        <h3>The "Bankrupt-Proof SPV" Structural Model</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates a "Bankrupt-Proof SPV" model, meaning that each Special Purpose Vehicle incorporated in the ADGM serves as a passive holding vehicle without active operational management responsibilities, banking relationships, or operational infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The SPV's sole function is to hold legal title to the underlying property and issue digital tokens representing ownership interests to investors.</p>
        <p>This structural model provides several operational and regulatory advantages. First, the passive nature of the SPV eliminates the need for the SPV to maintain banking relationships, employ staff, or conduct operational activities in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Second, the SPV's bankruptcy-remote structure protects investors from operational liabilities arising from property management activities.</p>
        <p>Third, the clear separation between ownership (SPV) and operations (Facilities Management Company) enables regulatory compliance in a jurisdiction where TLB does not maintain physical presence.</p>
        <p>The SPV structure is implemented through a three-tier hierarchy: the ADGM-incorporated SPV holds 100% of the shares of a Lebanese SARL (Société à Responsabilité Limitée), which in turn holds legal title to the physical property.</p>
        <p>This structure enables enforcement through the New York Convention (to which Lebanon is a signatory) while maintaining ADGM governance over the ownership structure.</p>

        <h3>Target Market and Investor Classification</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates a dual-track qualification system for investor onboarding, distinguishing between Professional Clients and Retail Clients based on verified status and demonstrated investment knowledge. This framework enables the platform to serve a broader investor base while maintaining appropriate investor protection standards.</p>
        <p>The qualification system is not wealth-exclusive. Rather than requiring all investors to demonstrate High-Net-Worth status (which would exclude the majority of the target diaspora market), TLB permits retail participation subject to knowledge-based qualification requirements.</p>
        <p>This approach aligns with the PFP regulatory framework while expanding access to investors who can demonstrate requisite understanding of the investment product.</p>
        <p><strong>Professional Clients</strong> may access the platform through an expedited verification process based on their verified professional status and financial capability. Professional Client status is established through verification of assets exceeding USD 500,000 (excluding primary residence), professional certification in relevant financial services fields, or status as an entity regulated by a recognized financial authority.</p>
        <p>Professional Clients have access to all platform features including primary market investment, secondary market bulletin board participation (from Day One), and all educational resources. No investment caps apply to Professional Clients per asset offering.</p>
        <p><strong>Retail Clients</strong> may access the platform through the PFP retail exemption, subject to a maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering and mandatory knowledge-based qualification through the Mastery Assessment.</p>
        <p>Retail Clients may invest at tiered minimum amounts in the mid-to-low five-figure USD range (
