        <h2>Document 1: Regulatory Business Plan (RBP)</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction and Business Concept</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani Ltd ("TLB" or "the Platform") proposes to establish a regulated digital securities platform enabling diaspora investors to acquire ownership interests in Lebanese real estate assets through a compliant ADGM framework.</p>
        <p>The platform addresses a significant market gap: Lebanese diaspora investors seeking to maintain connection to their home country through property ownership currently lack access to regulated, secure investment vehicles that provide the transparency, governance, and enforceability they require.</p>
        <p>The platform's core value proposition is "hands-free" property ownership—enabling investors to acquire real estate assets in Lebanon without the management burdens, cross-border enforcement challenges, and banking obstacles that have traditionally prevented diaspora participation.</p>
        <p>By structuring investments through bankruptcy-remote Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) incorporated in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), Token Lebnani provides investors with the legal protections of a premier common law jurisdiction while gaining exposure to Lebanese property markets. In addition to Regulatory Base Capital, Token Lebnani maintains a liquid Wind-Down Reserve equivalent to 50% of Annual Operating Expenses, representing approximately six months of operational runway.</p>
        <p>This reserve ensures that, in the event of business cessation, Token Lebnani has sufficient liquid resources to effect an orderly wind-down, complete remaining investor obligations, and discharge regulatory responsibilities.</p>
        <p>The Wind-Down Reserve is maintained in cash or highly liquid instruments accessible within standard banking timeframes, is segregated from operational accounts, and is not utilized for day-to-day business activities.</p>

        <h3>Regulatory Positioning and License Scope</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani seeks a Category 4 Financial Services Permission under the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) framework.</p>
        <p>The Category 4 license authorizes the regulated activity of "Arranging Deals in Investments," which enables TLB to facilitate primary market issuance of digital securities representing ownership in real estate assets located in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The Category 4 license scope is explicitly limited to arranging activities. TLB does not operate and is not authorized to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF), Exchange, or Custodian.</p>
        <p>This distinction is fundamental to the platform's regulatory positioning and capital structure. The Category 4 framework provides significant capital efficiency advantages compared to higher-tier licenses while enabling the platform to offer institutional-grade investment infrastructure for digital securities.</p>
        <p>Under the Private Financing Platform (PFP) framework applicable within the ADGM RegLab environment, TLB may accept Retail Clients subject to the PFP retail exemption, which permits a maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering without requiring a full prospectus.</p>
        <p>This exemption enables TLB to serve a broader investor base than platforms limited to professional clients only, subject to enhanced suitability and disclosure requirements.</p>

        <h3>The "Bankrupt-Proof SPV" Structural Model</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates a "Bankrupt-Proof SPV" model, meaning that each Special Purpose Vehicle incorporated in the ADGM serves as a passive holding vehicle without active operational management responsibilities, banking relationships, or operational infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The SPV's sole function is to hold legal title to the underlying property and issue digital tokens representing ownership interests to investors.</p>
        <p>This structural model provides several operational and regulatory advantages. First, the passive nature of the SPV eliminates the need for the SPV to maintain banking relationships, employ staff, or conduct operational activities in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Second, the SPV's bankruptcy-remote structure protects investors from operational liabilities arising from property management activities.</p>
        <p>Third, the clear separation between ownership (SPV) and operations (Facilities Management Company) enables regulatory compliance in a jurisdiction where TLB does not maintain physical presence.</p>
        <p>The SPV structure is implemented through a three-tier hierarchy: the ADGM-incorporated SPV holds 100% of the shares of a Lebanese SARL (Société à Responsabilité Limitée), which in turn holds legal title to the physical property.</p>
        <p>This structure enables enforcement through the New York Convention (to which Lebanon is a signatory) while maintaining ADGM governance over the ownership structure.</p>

        <h3>Target Market and Investor Classification</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates a dual-track qualification system for investor onboarding, distinguishing between Professional Clients and Retail Clients based on verified status and demonstrated investment knowledge. This framework enables the platform to serve a broader investor base while maintaining appropriate investor protection standards.</p>
        <p>The qualification system is not wealth-exclusive. Rather than requiring all investors to demonstrate High-Net-Worth status (which would exclude the majority of the target diaspora market), TLB permits retail participation subject to knowledge-based qualification requirements.</p>
        <p>This approach aligns with the PFP regulatory framework while expanding access to investors who can demonstrate requisite understanding of the investment product.</p>
        <p><strong>Professional Clients</strong> may access the platform through an expedited verification process based on their verified professional status and financial capability. Professional Client status is established through verification of assets exceeding USD 500,000 (excluding primary residence), professional certification in relevant financial services fields, or status as an entity regulated by a recognized financial authority.</p>
        <p>Professional Clients have access to all platform features including primary market investment, secondary market bulletin board participation (from Day One), and all educational resources. No investment caps apply to Professional Clients per asset offering.</p>
        <p><strong>Retail Clients</strong> may access the platform through the PFP retail exemption, subject to a maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering and mandatory knowledge-based qualification through the Mastery Assessment.</p>
        <p>Retail Clients may invest at tiered minimum amounts in the mid-to-low five-figure USD range (specifically, USD 10,000 to USD 55,000 per asset).</p>
        <p>The Mastery Assessment is a comprehensive evaluation designed to verify that Retail Clients possess requisite understanding of the investment product, covering risk recognition, asset structure comprehension, and platform mechanics.</p>
        <p>Target investors are defined based on investment intent and motivation rather than demographic factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legacy Investors:</strong> Diaspora investors seeking to maintain connection to Lebanon through property ownership, prioritizing stability and capital preservation.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Allocators:</strong> High-Net-Worth Individuals and family offices seeking yield diversification through emerging market real estate.</li>
            <li><strong>Passive Beneficiaries:</strong> Investors seeking hands-free property exposure without management responsibilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Facilities Management Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The Facilities Management Company (FMC) serves as the operational arm of each property SPV, responsible for all day-to-day property management functions that would otherwise require direct investor involvement or SPV administrative burden.</p>
        <p>The FMC enables the SPV structure to function as a passive holding vehicle while ensuring properties are actively maintained, tenants are managed, and revenues are collected and remitted in accordance with platform protocols. The FMC operates under binding contractual obligations establishing performance standards and accountability mechanisms.</p>
        <p>Key obligations include fiduciary duty to the SPV for all collected revenues, maintenance of complete transaction records for a minimum of seven years, transparency and disclosure of any conflicts of interest or material changes in ownership or financial condition, cooperation with platform governance processes including investor voting and regulatory reporting, and maintenance of appropriate insurance coverage including professional indemnity and public liability insurance.</p>
        <p>FMC performance is monitored through the established KPI framework with quarterly assessment and remediation procedures for underperformance.</p>
        <p>The FMC is selected, contracted, and monitored by TLB on behalf of the SPV following a qualitative assessment based on demonstrated capabilities. Selection criteria include operational capability, local market knowledge, financial management competence, technology and reporting capability, and regulatory awareness.</p>
        <p>The FMC's primary obligation is to the SPV, with performance standards and reporting requirements established in the FMC Agreement and monitored through the platform's governance infrastructure. Key responsibilities include revenue collection and management, tenant management, property maintenance and repairs, vendor coordination, regulatory compliance and tax administration, and quarterly reporting.</p>
        <p>The FMC Agreement includes defined termination provisions protecting all parties and ensuring continuity of property management. For-cause termination permits immediate termination upon material breach, fraud, gross negligence, or sustained performance failure. For-convenience termination permits either party to terminate upon ninety days written notice.</p>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates under the principle that outsourcing operational functions to third parties does not outsource regulatory responsibility. Under ADGM GEN Rule 3.3 (Outsourcing), the regulated entity remains ultimately accountable to the Financial Services Regulatory Authority for all outsourced functions. Token Lebnani's liability for FMC performance is direct and non-delegable.</p>

        <h3>Payment Infrastructure and Non-Custodial Model</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates a strictly non-custodial model with respect to investor funds and property owner proceeds. All fund flows are processed through a UAE-licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) partner, eliminating any touchpoint between the platform's operations and the Lebanese banking infrastructure.</p>
        <p>This architecture aligns with the platform's regulatory obligation to maintain separation of client assets. The non-custodial model ensures that TLB never takes possession, control, or custody of investor funds at any stage of the transaction lifecycle.</p>
        <p>Investor funds flow from the investor to the Partner's corporate account, through the settlement ledger, to token distribution and owner distribution. TLB's sole banking relationship is a single corporate account for operational purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>Primary Market Investment Flow:</strong> Investors fund primary market purchases by sending fiat currency or accepted virtual assets to the Partner's UAE corporate account. The Partner credits the equivalent value to the settlement ledger and confirms investor verification status. Upon primary market close, the Partner executes token distribution to investor wallets and credits the property owner's distribution share to the settlement ledger.</p>
        <p><strong>FMC Revenue Collection and Remittance:</strong> The FMC maintains Lebanese banking relationships solely for the purpose of collecting rental income from local tenants. The FMC converts collected rents to USD and initiates international wire transfers to the Partner's UAE corporate account. The Partner reconciles and executes wallet distributions in accordance with the settlement cycle defined in the Partner Service Level Agreement.</p>

        <h3>Token Structure and Digital Securities</h3>
        <p>All tokens issued through the platform are Digital Securities under ADGM law. This classification applies uniformly regardless of investor type, investment amount, or qualification pathway.</p>
        <p>The token itself carries uniform characteristics: it represents direct ownership interest in the SPV, carries equivalent rights regardless of whether the investor is a Professional Client or Retail Client, and is subject to the same regulatory treatment under ADGM law.</p>
        <p>Tokens are issued using ERC-1400 or equivalent standards suitable for regulated securities. The standard enables transfer restrictions, investor whitelisting, and compliance controls embedded in the token contract.</p>
        <p>Before receiving tokens, investors must complete verification and be added to the platform's investor whitelist. The whitelist is maintained by the platform and updated based on verification status. Only whitelisted investors may receive tokens from primary or secondary market transactions.</p>

        <h3>Compliance and AML/CFT Framework</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani maintains compliance infrastructure consistent with ADGM requirements, including AML/CFT policies, KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and regulatory reporting capabilities. Compliance functions are managed by qualified personnel with appropriate expertise.</p>
        <p>The AML/CFT Program is predicated on a risk-based approach that allocates resources in proportion to the assessed risk profile of customers, transactions, and geographic exposure. This approach recognizes that the Lebanese jurisdiction presents elevated AML/CFT risks arising from banking sector instability, FATF grey-list status, and the complexity of cross-border fund flows, and accordingly applies enhanced controls proportionate to these risk factors.</p>
        <p>The AML/CFT governance structure comprises three lines of defense. The first line comprises business functions engaged in customer onboarding and transaction processing. The second line comprises the compliance function, including the MLRO, responsible for designing policies and monitoring effectiveness. The third line comprises internal audit, providing independent assurance on the framework's effectiveness.</p>
        <p>For customers connected to Lebanon, enhanced EDD procedures apply, including specific verification of the legitimacy of fund flows through the Lebanese banking system, assessment of the customer's connection to Lebanese political or military figures, and specific attention to sanctions compliance given Lebanon's FATF grey-list status.</p>
        <p>All employees and relevant third parties receive AML/CFT training appropriate to their role and responsibilities. Token Lebnani implements a regulator-first hiring process for Controlled Function positions designed to ensure candidates meet the highest standards of integrity and competence.</p>
        <p>All prospective candidates undergo pre-screening against global sanctions lists including the UN Consolidated List, OFAC Specially Designated Nationals List, and EU Sanctions List, as well as enhanced due diligence screening through World-Check or equivalent databases. Finalist candidates are subjected to a rigorous Mock Regulator Interview conducted by Legal Counsel or the Compliance Partner to assess regulatory knowledge and response capability.</p>

        <h3>Risk Factors and Mitigation</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani has identified several material risk factors inherent in its business model and operating environment.</p>
        <p><strong>Jurisdictional and Enforcement Risk</strong> arises from properties being located in Lebanon, requiring cross-border enforcement mechanisms. While arbitration awards are enforceable through the New York Convention and court judgments may be enforced through the Riyadh Arab Agreement or Lebanese reciprocity principles, actual enforcement depends on Lebanese judicial cooperation and may face practical challenges including currency conversion risk at potentially unfavorable exchange rates.</p>
        <p><strong>Reliance on FMC Performance</strong> is a key operational risk, as the platform's model depends on FMC performance for revenue collection and property maintenance. Specific risks include revenue collection risk in a cash-based environment, commingling risk where property revenues may temporarily mix with FMC operational funds, and operational continuity risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Liquidity Risk</strong> reflects that secondary market liquidity is not guaranteed. The Restricted Bulletin Board provides matching for Professional Clients only. Direct peer-to-peer secondary trading for Retail Clients is not currently permitted. Investors may be unable to sell tokens at desired prices or times, and Retail Clients should assume they must hold tokens for the life of the investment.</p>
        <p><strong>Regulatory Risk</strong> acknowledges that the framework for digital securities and cross-border investment continues to evolve. Regulatory changes could affect platform operations, token treatment, or investor access. Specific risks include classification risk, FSRA authorization risk, cross-border regulatory risk, and AML/CFT regulatory risk.</p>

        <h2>Document 3: Regulatory Analysis — Category 4 (Arranging) Framework</h2>
        
        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>This regulatory analysis demonstrates that Token Lebnani Ltd's proposed business model falls within the scope of the ADGM Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) Category 4 Financial Services Permission, specifically the regulated activity of "Arranging Deals in Investments."</p>
        <p>The analysis establishes that the Category 4 framework is the appropriate licensing pathway for Token Lebnani's primary market issuance activities, while clarifying the boundaries that distinguish arranging activities from market operator activities (MTF, Exchange) and custodian activities that would require higher-tier licensing.</p>

        <h3>Regulatory Framework Overview</h3>
        <p>The Abu Dhabi Global Market provides the regulatory jurisdiction for Token Lebnani's operations, with English Common Law principles governing commercial relationships and FSRA rules governing regulated activities.</p>
        <p>This jurisdiction provides significant advantages for cross-border real estate investment, including a well-developed common law framework, sophisticated financial services regulation, and international recognition of ADGM judgments and arbitration awards.</p>

        <h3>Category 4 License Scope</h3>
        <p>The Category 4 license authorizes the regulated activity of "Arranging Deals in Investments," which enables Token Lebnani to facilitate primary market issuance of digital securities representing ownership in real estate assets located in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Under this framework, Token Lebnani serves as an intermediary that brings together investors and investment opportunities, without taking possession of client assets, operating a trading venue, or providing custody services.</p>
        <p>The Category 4 license scope is explicitly limited to arranging activities. Token Lebnani does not operate and is not authorized to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF), Exchange, or Custodian.</p>

        <h3>Arranging Activity Analysis</h3>
        <p>Under ADGM FSMR Schedule 1, Part 1, Paragraph 25, "Arranging Deals in Investments" encompasses activities where a person brings together parties to a transaction, facilitates transactions between parties, or gives advice in connection with such arrangements. The essence of arranging is the intermediary function—connecting buyers and sellers, issuers and investors—without becoming a principal to the transaction or providing the infrastructure on which trading occurs.</p>
        <p>Token Lebnani's primary market activities fall squarely within the arranging definition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Facilitation of Primary Market Issuance:</strong> Token Lebnani facilitates the issuance of digital securities by bringing together property owners seeking capital and investors seeking property ownership. The platform provides the infrastructure for offering presentation, investor qualification, and transaction execution, but does not purchase securities for its own account or sell securities from its own inventory.</li>
            <li><strong>Matched Redemption for Retail Clients:</strong> For retail secondary market access, Token Lebnani operates a Matched Redemption mechanism. This mechanism does not involve the platform purchasing securities from its own account. Instead, when a Retail Client seeks to exit, their redemption request is queued and satisfied only when the platform sources matching liquidity from new incoming subscriptions. The existing investor's tokens are transferred directly to the new subscriber, with proceeds from the new subscription funding the redemption. The platform never holds tokens as inventory or acts as a counterparty to Retail Clients.</li>
            <li><strong>Investor Qualification and Onboarding:</strong> Token Lebnani operates a dual-track qualification system verifying investor status and ensuring appropriate investment suitability. This function supports the arranging activity by ensuring that only qualified investors participate in offerings, but does not constitute discretionary portfolio management or investment advice.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Facilitation:</strong> All primary market transactions are executed through the VASP partner infrastructure. Token Lebnani coordinates the transaction process—including offering structure, pricing, and closing—but the actual settlement occurs through the regulated VASP partner, not through Token Lebnani itself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Contrast with Market Operator Activities</h3>
        <p>The FSRA distinguishes arranging from market operator activities under Paragraph 29 of Schedule 1, which governs Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) and exchanges. Key distinguishing factors include:</p>
        <div class="table-wrapper">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Characteristic</th>
                    <th>Arranging (Category 4)</th>
                    <th>Market Operator (MTF/Exchange)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Order Matching</td>
                    <td>Does not match buy and sell orders</td>
                    <td>Operates order book, matches orders</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Trading Venue</td>
                    <td>No continuous trading facility</td>
                    <td>Provides continuous trading</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Price Formation</td>
                    <td>Issuer-determined pricing</td>
                    <td>Market-driven pricing</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Trading Hours</td>
                    <td>Primary market only</td>
                    <td>Continuous secondary trading</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Commissions</td>
                    <td>Arrangement fees only</td>
                    <td>Trading commissions</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>Token Lebnani explicitly operates within the arranging framework. The platform does not operate an order book, does not match buy and sell orders, does not provide continuous trading functionality, and does not charge trading commissions. The arranging activity is completed once the primary market transaction is executed.</p>

        <h3>Contrast with Custodian Activities</h3>
        <p>Custody activities—which would require higher-tier licensing—involve the taking possession or control of client assets for safekeeping, settlement, or management purposes. Token Lebnani operates a strictly non-custodial model, ensuring that the platform never takes possession, control, or custody of investor funds at any stage of the transaction lifecycle.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-Custodial Architecture:</strong> Investor funds flow from the investor to the VASP Partner's corporate account, through the settlement ledger, to token distribution and owner distribution. Token Lebnani's sole banking relationship is a single corporate account for operational expenses. The platform never touches client funds or assets.</p>
        <p><strong>SPV Passivity:</strong> The ADGM-incorporated SPVs serve as passive holding vehicles without banking relationships or operational infrastructure. The SPV's sole function is to hold legal title and issue tokens. This passive structure ensures that neither Token Lebnani nor the SPV operates as a custodian of investor assets.</p>

        <h3>Private Financing Platform Framework</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates within the Private Financing Platform (PFP) framework applicable within the ADGM RegLab environment. This framework provides specific accommodations for platforms facilitating investments without full prospectus requirements, subject to investor protection conditions.</p>
        <p>Under the PFP retail exemption, Token Lebnani may accept Retail Clients subject to the following parameters: Maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering; No full prospectus required for exempt offerings; Mandatory knowledge-based qualification (Mastery Assessment); Enhanced suitability and disclosure requirements; Tiered investment minimums (USD 10,000 to USD 55,000).</p>
        <p>This exemption enables Token Lebnani to serve a broader investor base than platforms limited to professional clients only, while maintaining appropriate investor protection standards.</p>

        <h3>Secondary Market Limitations</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani's Category 4 license explicitly authorizes primary market issuance activities but does not authorize the operation of a trading venue. The arranging activity is completed once the primary market transaction is executed.</p>
        <p><strong>Professional Client Secondary Access:</strong> Initial secondary market access for Professional Clients operates as a peer-to-peer bulletin board where Professional Clients may post intentions to buy or sell tokens. This mechanism facilitates introductions between willing buyers and sellers without requiring Token Lebnani to operate a trading venue or obtain MTF authorization. The platform displays order indications without executing matches, and interested parties contact each other directly to negotiate.</p>
        <p><strong>Retail Client Secondary Access:</strong> Direct peer-to-peer secondary trading for Retail Clients is not permitted under the current license. To provide liquidity options for Retail Clients, Token Lebnani operates a "Matched Redemption" mechanism permissible under ADGM Companies Regulations. Redemption requests are held in a queue and are strictly conditional upon the company sourcing matching liquidity from new incoming subscriptions. Upon receipt of funds from a new subscriber, the company utilizes the proceeds to fund the redemption of the existing investor's tokens.</p>
        <p><strong>MTF Partnership Approach:</strong> Broader secondary market access is facilitated through partnerships with ADGM-licensed Multilateral Trading Facilities. This approach provides investors with access to established trading infrastructure without requiring Token Lebnani to obtain separate market operator authorization.</p>

        <h3>Cross-Border Enforcement Framework</h3>
        <p>The ADGM provides the regulatory jurisdiction for Token Lebnani's operations. Arbitration awards issued in the ADGM are enforceable in Lebanon through the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958), to which both the UAE and Lebanon are signatories.</p>
        <p>The platform's legal architecture is designed to ensure that all material agreements incorporate ADGM arbitration clauses, enabling dispute resolution within the ADGM framework rather than Lebanese courts, which may face capacity constraints and processing delays.</p>
        <p>ADGM court judgments may be enforced in Lebanon under the Riyadh Arab Agreement for Judicial Cooperation (1983) and the principles of reciprocity governed by the Lebanese Code of Civil Procedure. These enforcement mechanisms provide investors with meaningful recourse in the event of property disputes or ownership conflicts, despite the physical assets being located in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The Arbitrator shall be explicitly empowered to issue awards denominated in US Dollars and to mandate that any payment be made in fresh US Dollars (or equivalent stablecoin) to a designated account outside of Lebanon, to the extent permitted by applicable law. This provision is intended to minimize currency conversion risk during enforcement and to provide investors with recourse that is not subject to Lebanese exchange rate mechanisms.</p>

        <h3>AML/CFT Regulatory Compliance</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani's AML/CFT Program is predicated on a risk-based approach that allocates resources in proportion to the assessed risk profile of customers, transactions, and geographic exposure. This approach recognizes that the Lebanese jurisdiction presents elevated AML/CFT risks arising from banking sector instability, FATF grey-list status, and the complexity of cross-border fund flows, and accordingly applies enhanced controls proportionate to these risk factors.</p>
        <p>For customers connected to Lebanon, enhanced EDD procedures apply, including specific verification of the legitimacy of fund flows through the Lebanese banking system, assessment of the customer's connection to Lebanese political or military figures, and specific attention to sanctions compliance given Lebanon's FATF grey-list status.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani's proposed business model falls squarely within the Category 4 (Arranging) framework. The platform serves as an intermediary facilitating primary market issuance of digital securities representing real estate ownership, without operating a trading venue, taking custody of client assets, or providing the infrastructure for continuous secondary trading.</p>
        <p>The Category 4 framework provides an appropriate regulatory pathway that balances the platform's operational objectives with investor protection requirements and capital efficiency considerations. The platform's non-custodial architecture, passive SPV structure, and clear delineation of arranging activities versus market operator activities confirm that Category 4 licensing is the appropriate framework.</p>
        <p>Secondary market access for professional and retail clients is addressed through permissible mechanisms (bulletin board, matched redemption) and planned MTF partnerships, without requiring Token Lebnani to obtain market operator authorization. The PFP framework provides appropriate accommodations for Retail Client access, while the platform's risk-based AML/CFT approach and enhanced due diligence procedures address the specific compliance considerations associated with cross-border investments in FATF grey-list jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>The platform's careful attention to cross-border enforcement mechanisms, including arbitration award enforcement through the New York Convention and court judgment enforcement through the Riyadh Arab Agreement, demonstrates regulatory sophistication appropriate to the complexities of the proposed business model.</p>

        <h2>Governance Hierarchy and Control Framework</h2>

        <h3>Governance Structure Overview</h3>
        <p>TLB operates under a governance structure designed to ensure clear accountability, appropriate oversight, and effective risk management while maintaining operational efficiency. The structure reflects the three-tier legal architecture, with distinct governance mechanisms for each layer.</p>

        <h3>Board of Directors</h3>
        <p>The Board of Directors holds ultimate responsibility for the firm's strategy, risk appetite, and governance. The Board comprises directors with appropriate expertise in financial services, regulatory compliance, and cross-border investments.</p>
        <p>The Board maintains distinct committees to oversee specific governance functions, including an Audit Committee responsible for financial reporting oversight and internal control effectiveness, a Risk Committee responsible for risk management framework oversight and risk appetite monitoring, and a Compliance Committee responsible for regulatory compliance monitoring and remediation oversight.</p>

        <h3>Three Lines of Defense Model</h3>
        <p>TLB implements the industry-standard three lines of defense model to ensure effective risk management and control.</p>
        <p><strong>First Line of Defense — Business Operations:</strong> The first line of defense comprises business functions responsible for operational activities and day-to-day risk management. These functions own and manage the risks inherent in their operations and are responsible for implementing effective controls to mitigate those risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Second Line of Defense — Compliance and Risk Management:</strong> The second line of defense comprises the compliance and risk management functions, which provide independent oversight of first-line activities. These functions are responsible for designing policies and procedures, monitoring the effectiveness of first-line controls, and providing guidance to business staff on risk and compliance matters.</p>
        <p><strong>Third Line of Defense — Internal Audit:</strong> The third line of defense comprises the internal audit function, which provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of the firm's risk management and control framework. Internal audit reviews are conducted on a risk-based schedule.</p>

        <h3>The "Triple-Lock" Binding Mechanism</h3>
        <p>The ADGM SPV's control is secured by three mechanisms:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Registered Share Pledge:</strong> Registered share pledge at Lebanese Commercial Register provides security for investors.</li>
            <li><strong>Management Services Agreement:</strong> The Management Services Agreement with TLB Ltd establishes control mechanisms and service standards.</li>
            <li><strong>ADGM-Seated Arbitration Clause:</strong> All key agreements contain binding ADGM-seated arbitration clauses, enabling dispute resolution within the ADGM framework.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This triple-lock structure ensures that investor rights are protected through multiple enforceable mechanisms.</p>

        <h3>Control Framework</h3>
        <p><strong>Financial Controls:</strong> Financial controls ensure the integrity of financial reporting and the proper handling of client assets. These controls include segregation of duties between authorization, processing, and reconciliation functions; daily reconciliation of client money holdings; approval processes for significant expenditures; and regular financial reporting to the Board.</p>
        <p><strong>Operational Controls:</strong> Operational controls ensure the effectiveness of platform operations and the protection of investor interests. These controls include documented procedures for all significant operational processes; segregation of duties between incompatible functions; access controls for sensitive systems and data; and business continuity and disaster recovery procedures.</p>
        <p><strong>Compliance Controls:</strong> Compliance controls ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and internal policies. These controls include AML/CFT policies and procedures; transaction monitoring and sanctions screening; customer due diligence requirements; and regulatory reporting obligations.</p>

        <h2>Proof of Concept (POC) Technical Brief</h2>

        <h3>Core Infrastructure: ERC-1400 Standard</h3>
        <p>Tokens issued through the platform are Digital Securities under ADGM law, representing direct ownership interests in the underlying property SPV. The platform issues tokens using ERC-1400 or equivalent standards suitable for regulated securities. This standard enables transfer restrictions, investor whitelisting, and compliance controls embedded directly in the token contract.</p>
        <p>Compliance Capabilities include transfer restrictions enforced at the smart contract level, investor whitelisting integrated with KYC verification process, and compliance controls embedded in the token contract.</p>
        <p>Platform Infrastructure utilizes a white-label technology provider (DigiShares or equivalent) for core infrastructure. The platform integrates with the VASP partner for fiat on/off ramp capabilities, wallet infrastructure, and settlement processing.</p>

        <h3>Non-Custodial Model</h3>
        <p>TLB operates a strictly non-custodial model with respect to investor funds and property owner proceeds. All fund flows are processed through a UAE-licensed VASP partner. Investors connect via WalletConnect; TLB never accesses private keys. The non-custodial model ensures that TLB never takes possession, control, or custody of investor funds at any stage of the transaction lifecycle.</p>

        <h3>AML/CFT and Integrity Controls</h3>
        <p><strong>Transaction Monitoring:</strong> The platform maintains a transaction monitoring system capable of detecting patterns and individual transactions that may indicate money laundering, terrorist financing, or other financial crime. The system is calibrated based on the firm's AML/CFT Risk Assessment.</p>
        <p><strong>Sanctions Screening:</strong> All customers and counterparties are screened against relevant sanctions lists prior to onboarding and on an ongoing basis. Wallet screening is conducted for customers transacting in virtual assets.</p>
        <p><strong>Assessment Integrity:</strong> The Mastery Assessment includes biometric verification to confirm investor identity during assessment completion. Dynamic question/answer shuffling prevents predictability.</p>
        <p><strong>EDD for Lebanon-Linked Parties:</strong> Enhanced due diligence procedures apply to customers connected to Lebanon, including specific verification of the legitimacy of fund flows through the Lebanese banking system.</p>

        <h3>FRT Routing Clarification</h3>
        <p>Dividend distributions utilize "Accepted FRTs" (Fiat-Referenced Tokens). TLB is not an FRT Issuer or Payment Service Provider. The smart contract acts as a technology router, facilitating the direct transfer of FRTs from the Project SPV's segregated reserve account to the investor's verified wallet. TLB never takes possession or control of the FRTs. Dividend distribution is a permissioned, automated routing instruction from SPV reserve to investor wallet. TLB is not a counterparty.</p>

        <h3>Audit Commitment</h3>
        <p><strong>Technology Security:</strong> The platform maintains appropriate security controls to protect investor information and platform integrity, including encryption of sensitive data, access controls, regular security testing, and incident response procedures.</p>
        <p><strong>Smart Contract Audit:</strong> Commitment to annual third-party security audits of production tokenization smart contracts. These audits verify that smart contracts function as designed and that security controls are effective.</p>

    <div id="wind-down" class="dossier-section">
        <h2>Resolution and Cessation (Wind-Down) Plan</h2>

        <h3>Resolution Framework</h3>
        <p>The platform maintains a comprehensive resolution framework designed to ensure orderly cessation of operations while protecting investor interests, maintaining regulatory compliance, and preserving the integrity of the SPV structure. This framework addresses potential wind-down scenarios ranging from strategic business cessation to regulatory intervention, ensuring that Token Lebnani can effect an orderly wind-down without prejudice to stakeholder interests regardless of the circumstances precipitating cessation.</p>
        <p>The framework recognizes that wind-down scenarios may arise from multiple potential triggers, each requiring different response protocols and timelines. The platform has established procedures that prioritize investor protection, regulatory compliance, and the preservation of value throughout the resolution process. These procedures are designed to provide confidence to regulators, investors, and counterparties that Token Lebnani has thoughtfully considered its obligations in adverse scenarios.</p>

        <h3>Trigger Events</h3>
        <p>Wind-down trigger events are categorized into three tiers based on their nature and the urgency of response required.</p>
        <p><strong>Regulatory triggers</strong> include FSRA license revocation or suspension, formal enforcement action that materially impairs operational capacity, and direction from the regulator to cease specific activities or the totality of operations. Regulatory triggers receive immediate response with same-day notification to the FSRA and activation of the Standby Servicer.</p>
        <p><strong>Financial triggers</strong> include capital adequacy falling below regulatory minimums, inability to meet financial obligations as they fall due, and significant losses that threaten the viability of the business model. Financial triggers trigger immediate assessment with Board convening within 24 hours to determine response.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic triggers</strong> include Board determination that continuation is no longer viable, failure to secure necessary regulatory approvals within defined timeframes, and force majeure events preventing continued operations. Strategic triggers follow standard wind-down procedures with Board oversight throughout.</p>
        <p>Upon occurrence of any trigger event, the SEO shall immediately notify the Board and initiate the response protocol appropriate to the trigger classification.</p>

        <h3>Decision-Making Authority</h3>
        <p>The Board of Directors maintains ultimate responsibility for wind-down decisions. For trigger events classified as regulatory or financial, the SEO is authorized to initiate immediate protective measures including asset preservation, notification to key counterparties, and activation of the Standby Servicer pending Board convening. The Board shall convene within defined timeframes based on trigger classification to formalize the wind-down decision and oversee implementation.</p>
        <p>For strategic triggers, the Board initiates the wind-down through formal resolution, appointing a Wind-Down Manager who assumes operational control of the wind-down process. The Wind-Down Manager may be the SEO, a designated Board member, or an external professional appointed for this purpose, depending on the circumstances of the trigger event and the availability of qualified individuals.</p>

        <h3>The "Standby Servicer" Model</h3>
        <p>Upon determination that wind-down is required, a pre-contracted ADGM-licensed Corporate Service Provider (CSP) assumes administrative duties of the Project SPVs. This Standby Servicer arrangement ensures that SPV administration continues uninterrupted regardless of Token Lebnani's operational status, providing continuity of corporate governance and regulatory compliance throughout the wind-down period.</p>
        <p>The Standby Servicer relationship is established prior to platform launch through a contractual arrangement that activates automatically upon wind-down trigger. This pre-positioning ensures that no gap exists between Token Lebnani's operational cessation and the assumption of SPV administration by the Standby Servicer. The Standby Servicer is selected based on demonstrated experience with SPV administration, familiarity with the ADGM regulatory framework, and capacity to assume administration on short notice.</p>
        
        <h3>Standby Servicer Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>The Standby Servicer maintains responsibility for four primary functions throughout the wind-down period.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Corporate records and filings:</strong> Maintaining SPV statutory registers, filing required returns with ADGM authorities, and preserving corporate documentation in accordance with regulatory requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Property management continuity:</strong> Coordinating with the incumbent FMC to ensure uninterrupted property operations, monitoring FMC performance during the transition period, and implementing contingency arrangements if FMC continuity is threatened.</li>
            <li><strong>Distribution management:</strong> Processing investor distributions in accordance with SPV agreements, calculating entitlement to remaining assets, and executing distributions in a manner consistent with the priority established in the wind-down plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory liaison:</strong> Responding to regulatory inquiries, filing required notifications, and coordinating with the FSRA throughout the wind-down period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>FMC Continuity During Wind-Down</h3>
        <p>The physical asset management function remains with the incumbent third-party Facilities Management company under a long-term, survival-based contract. This arrangement is fundamental to the wind-down framework because it ensures that property operations continue without disruption regardless of Token Lebnani's status.</p>
        <p>The FMC Agreement includes provisions that survive termination of the Token Lebnani relationship, binding the FMC to continue operations under Standby Servicer oversight. The FMC continuity provisions include specific triggers for intervention if FMC performance is threatened during the wind-down period.</p>
        <p>The Standby Servicer holds step-in rights that permit immediate replacement of the FMC upon evidence of insolvency, breach of key performance indicators, or any circumstance that threatens property management continuity. Backup FMC relationships are maintained to ensure that property management can continue without interruption.</p>

        <h3>Orderly 6-Month Wind-Down</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani maintains a Wind-Down Buffer to fund an orderly cessation over six months. This buffer is maintained in cash or highly liquid instruments accessible within standard banking timeframes, segregated from operational accounts and not utilized for day-to-day business activities. The Wind-Down Buffer is calibrated to cover professional fees, regulatory obligations, and essential services required during the wind-down period.</p>
        <p>The wind-down process is divided into four distinct phases, each with specific objectives, activities, and timeline. This phased approach ensures that the wind-down proceeds methodically, preserving value, protecting investors, and meeting regulatory requirements throughout the process.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 1 — Immediate Response (Days 1-7):</strong> The immediate response phase focuses on stabilization, notification, and activation of wind-down infrastructure. Within 24 hours of wind-down trigger, the SEO or Wind-Down Manager notifies the Board and the FSRA of the wind-down decision, providing initial assessment of circumstances and proposed timeline. The Standby Servicer is formally activated and assumes SPV administrative responsibilities. Investor communication is prepared and distributed within 72 hours of trigger, providing investors with clear information about the wind-down process, their rights, and expected timeline. Immediate actions include securing all platform records and documentation, confirming FMC operational status, verifying investor register accuracy, and identifying any immediate regulatory reporting obligations. The phase concludes with confirmation that all key stakeholders have been notified and the wind-down infrastructure is operational.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 2 — Asset and Record Preservation (Days 8-30):</strong> The preservation phase focuses on securing assets, documenting the current state, and completing regulatory notifications. All platform records are secured and preserved in accessible format. Asset valuations are updated to reflect current market conditions. Investor registers are verified against primary documentation to ensure accuracy. Regulatory notifications are completed including any required filings with ADGM authorities. During this phase, the Wind-Down Manager completes assessment of SPV assets and liabilities, identifying any actions required to preserve value. Property condition assessments are conducted in coordination with the FMC. Distribution calculations are prepared based on verified investor registers and SPV asset values.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 3 — Distribution and Cessation (Days 31-90):</strong> The distribution phase focuses on completing the wind-down of Token Lebnani operations and executing initial investor distributions. Final distributions are calculated and processed in accordance with the priority established in this framework. Remaining assets are liquidated as necessary to complete distributions. Regulatory approvals for dissolution are obtained. Final investor communications are distributed providing detailed distribution information and next steps. Distributions are calculated on a pro-rata basis reflecting each investor's proportionate ownership interest in the relevant SPV. Distributions may be made in kind (through transfer of property interests or other assets) or in cash (through sale of assets and distribution of proceeds) depending on the circumstances of each SPV. Investors receive detailed documentation of the calculation basis for their distribution.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 4 — Dissolution (Days 91-180):</strong> The dissolution phase focuses on completing the legal termination of Token Lebnani and SPV entities. Corporate entities are dissolved in accordance with ADGM requirements. Final regulatory filings are completed. The Wind-Down Buffer is depleted as final professional fees and obligations are discharged. During this phase, the Standby Servicer completes its responsibilities regarding SPV administration, transitioning remaining matters to final resolution. Confirmation of dissolution is communicated to all stakeholders. Final records are archived in accordance with regulatory requirements.</p>

        <h3>Investor Protection in Wind-Down</h3>
        <p>Wind-down procedures prioritize investor interests throughout the process. The framework establishes clear principles governing the treatment of investors during wind-down, ensuring that investor rights are protected and distributions are executed fairly and transparently.</p>
        <p><strong>Token Ownership Rights:</strong> Investor token ownership rights are maintained throughout the wind-down process. Tokens continue to represent ownership interests in the underlying property SPV regardless of Token Lebnani's operational status. The Standby Servicer ensures that property ownership rights are preserved and that investor interests are protected throughout the wind-down period. Investors are not required to take any action to maintain their ownership rights during wind-down. The wind-down process operates at the SPV level, preserving the token structure and the rights it represents. Upon distribution, investors receive either direct ownership of their proportionate interest or cash equivalent based on the nature of the SPV assets and the circumstances of wind-down.</p>
        <p><strong>Distribution Priority:</strong> Distributions are executed in accordance with established priority that protects investor interests while meeting regulatory and contractual obligations. Investor entitlements rank first, with distributions to token holders calculated based on verified ownership and SPV asset values. Secured creditors receive distributions according to the terms of their security arrangements. Unsecured creditors rank next, with distributions based on validated claims. Any remaining value is distributed to the shareholder of the SPV.</p>
        <p><strong>Communication and Transparency:</strong> Investors receive regular communications throughout the wind-down process, providing transparency regarding progress, challenges, and expected outcomes. Initial communication confirms the wind-down trigger and provides timeline expectations. Phase communications provide progress updates and identify any matters requiring investor attention. Final communication confirms distributions and provides documentation of the distribution calculation. Investors have access to a dedicated communication channel throughout the wind-down period, enabling them to request information and raise concerns. The Wind-Down Manager responds to investor inquiries within defined timeframes, ensuring that investors are not left without information during this critical period.</p>
        <p><strong>Property Management Continuity:</strong> FMC continuity provisions ensure that property management continues throughout the wind-down period. Properties remain maintained, tenants remain managed, and revenues continue to be collected and distributed to investors in accordance with the wind-down timeline. The Standby Servicer oversees FMC performance during this period, ensuring that property values are preserved and investor interests are protected. The FMC Agreement includes specific provisions governing behavior during wind-down, including continued performance obligations, cooperation requirements with the Standby Servicer, and transition obligations if FMC replacement becomes necessary. These provisions ensure that property management continues without interruption regardless of circumstances affecting Token Lebnani.</p>

    <div id="suitability" class="dossier-section">
        <h2>Client Suitability Framework</h2>

        <h3>Dual-Track Qualification System</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates a dual-track qualification system for investor onboarding, distinguishing between Professional Clients and Retail Clients based on verified status and demonstrated investment knowledge. This framework enables the platform to serve a broader investor base while maintaining appropriate investor protection standards aligned with the PFP regulatory framework and ADGM COBS requirements.</p>
        <p>The qualification system is not wealth-exclusive. Rather than requiring all investors to demonstrate High-Net-Worth status (which would exclude the majority of the target diaspora market), Token Lebnani permits retail participation subject to knowledge-based qualification requirements. This approach expands access to investors who can demonstrate requisite understanding of the investment product while ensuring appropriate protection for those investors who may not possess sophisticated financial backgrounds or professional investment experience.</p>

        <h3>Professional Client Track</h3>
        <p>Professional Clients may access the platform through an expedited verification process based on their verified professional status and financial capability. No knowledge assessment or Mastery Assessment is required for Professional Client onboarding, reflecting the regulatory presumption that professional investors possess sufficient experience and judgment to evaluate investment opportunities without additional qualification requirements.</p>
        <p>Professional Client status is established through verification of assets exceeding USD 500,000 (excluding primary residence), professional certification in relevant financial services fields, or status as an entity regulated by a recognized financial authority. Verification is conducted through document review and due diligence procedures consistent with ADGM COBS requirements, including verification of asset ownership, professional credentials, or regulatory status as appropriate to the claimed classification.</p>
        <p>Professional Clients have access to all platform features including primary market investment, secondary market bulletin board participation (from Day One), and all educational resources. No investment caps apply to Professional Clients per asset offering, reflecting the regulatory expectation that professional investors can determine appropriate position sizing based on their individual circumstances and risk tolerance.</p>

        <h3>Retail Client Track</h3>
        <p>Retail Clients may access the platform through the PFP retail exemption, subject to a maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering and mandatory knowledge-based qualification through the Mastery Assessment. This qualification requirement is fundamental to the platform's investor protection framework and represents the primary mechanism through which the platform ensures that retail investors understand the nature and risks of the investment before committing capital.</p>
        <p>Retail Clients may invest at tiered minimum amounts in the mid-to-low five-figure USD range (specifically, USD 10,000 to USD 55,000 per asset). These minimums are tiered based on asset characteristics, investor classification, and regulatory requirements. The specific minimum for each asset offering is disclosed in the Token Purchase Agreement and is designed to ensure that retail investors have meaningful exposure to the investment while maintaining accessibility for the target diaspora market.</p>

        <h3>Mastery Assessment Requirements</h3>
        <p>The Mastery Assessment is a comprehensive evaluation designed to verify that Retail Clients possess requisite understanding of the investment product. The assessment covers three primary domains that collectively ensure the investor has a complete understanding of the proposition they are entering into.</p>
        <p>The first domain is risk recognition, which encompasses understanding of property market risk (including the potential for capital value fluctuation and rental income variability), currency risk (particularly relevant given the Lebanese pound devaluation history and cross-border investment structure), jurisdictional risk (including the challenges of enforcing rights in a foreign jurisdiction), and liquidity risk (the possibility that investors may not be able to exit their investment when desired). Understanding these risks is essential for retail investors to make an informed decision about whether this investment is appropriate for their circumstances.</p>
        <p>The second domain is asset structure comprehension, which requires the investor to demonstrate understanding of the SPV ownership structure (how the tokens represent beneficial ownership in a special purpose vehicle incorporated in ADGM), token mechanics (how the tokens function as digital securities and what rights they confer), and investor rights (what entitlements the tokens provide and how those rights can be exercised). This structural understanding is essential because the platform's model differs significantly from direct property ownership, and investors must understand exactly what they are purchasing.</p>
        <p>The third domain is platform mechanics, which requires understanding of the investment process (how primary market subscriptions work and when tokens will be issued), the distribution mechanism (how rental income and other distributions will be calculated and paid), and secondary market limitations (what liquidity options are available and what restrictions apply). This operational understanding ensures that investors have realistic expectations about the investment experience.</p>
        <p>The assessment comprises a minimum of twenty questions drawn from a question bank, with a minimum passing score of 80%.</p>
        <p>Biometric verification confirms investor identity during assessment completion to prevent proxy testing, ensuring that the person completing the assessment is the same person who will hold the investment.</p>
        <p>Red-flag questions address fundamental misconceptions that result in automatic failure regardless of overall score, such as misunderstanding the liquidity characteristics of the investment or the jurisdictional nature of the underlying assets.</p>
        <p>Retail clients who fail the Mastery Assessment may reattempt after a seven-day cooling period, providing time for reflection and study before a subsequent attempt. Three consecutive failures result in permanent exclusion from the Retail Client track for that investor, reflecting the platform's commitment to ensuring that retail investors possess the requisite understanding before participating in the investment.</p>

        <h3>Target Audience Profiles</h3>
        <p>Rather than age-based demographic targeting, Token Lebnani defines target investors based on investment intent and motivation. This approach focuses on investor characteristics relevant to the investment proposition rather than arbitrary demographic factors that may not correlate with investment sophistication or suitability.</p>
        <p><strong>Legacy Investors</strong> are diaspora investors seeking to maintain connection to Lebanon through property ownership. These investors typically hold capital outside Lebanon, possess familiarity with Lebanese culture and market conditions, and prioritize stability and capital preservation over aggressive yield maximization. Legacy Investors may invest at either Professional or Retail levels depending on their asset base and willingness to complete the Mastery Assessment where required. This profile represents a core target market for the platform, as the proposition of "hands-free" property ownership without direct management responsibilities aligns well with investors who value connection to Lebanon but may not have the capacity or desire to manage property directly from abroad.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Allocators</strong> are High-Net-Worth Individuals and family offices seeking yield diversification through emerging market real estate. These investors typically have established portfolios in developed markets and seek exposure to frontier market returns with the risk mitigation provided by the platform's structural protections. Strategic Allocators invest primarily through the Professional Client track, reflecting their professional investment experience and capacity for larger position sizes. This profile represents an important source of capital for larger property offerings and provides liquidity support for the platform's secondary market mechanisms.</p>
        <p><strong>Passive Beneficiaries</strong> are investors seeking hands-free property exposure without the management responsibilities associated with direct property ownership. These investors value the platform's operational infrastructure, including FMC management, revenue collection, and distribution services, as an alternative to direct landlord responsibilities. Passive Beneficiaries invest at Retail Client levels and rely on platform governance for operational oversight. This profile represents a significant segment of the target market, as many diaspora investors have successful careers and personal lives that leave limited time for direct property management but possess sufficient capital to invest in real estate through appropriate channels.</p>
