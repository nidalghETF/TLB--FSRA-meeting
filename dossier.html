        <h2>Document 1: Regulatory Business Plan (RBP)</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction and Business Concept</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani Ltd ("TLB" or "the Platform") proposes to establish a regulated digital securities platform enabling diaspora investors to acquire ownership interests in Lebanese real estate assets through a compliant ADGM framework. The platform addresses a significant market gap: Lebanese diaspora investors seeking to maintain connection to their home country through property ownership currently lack access to regulated, secure investment vehicles that provide the transparency, governance, and enforceability they require.</p>
        <p>The platform's core value proposition is "hands-free" property ownership—enabling investors to acquire real estate assets in Lebanon without the management burdens, cross-border enforcement challenges, and banking obstacles that have traditionally prevented diaspora participation. By structuring investments through bankruptcy-remote Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) incorporated in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), Token Lebnani provides investors with the legal protections of a premier common law jurisdiction while gaining exposure to Lebanese property markets.</p>
        <p>In addition to Regulatory Base Capital, Token Lebnani maintains a Wind-Down Reserve of USD 100,000, which forms part of the overall wind-down budget managed by the contracted Standby Servicer. This reserve covers professional fees, regulatory obligations, and essential services required during the wind-down period.</p>

        <h3>Regulatory Positioning and License Scope</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani seeks a Category 4 Financial Services Permission under the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) framework. The Category 4 license authorizes the regulated activity of "Arranging Deals in Investments," which enables TLB to facilitate primary market issuance of digital securities representing ownership in real estate assets located in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The Category 4 license scope is explicitly limited to arranging activities. TLB does not operate and is not authorized to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF), Exchange, or Custodian. This distinction is fundamental to the platform's regulatory positioning and capital structure.</p>
        <p>Under the Private Financing Platform (PFP) framework applicable within the ADGM RegLab environment, TLB serves Retail Clients subject to the PFP retail exemption, which permits a maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering without requiring a full prospectus.</p>

        <h3>The "Bankrupt-Proof SPV" Structural Model</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates a "Bankrupt-Proof SPV" model, meaning that each Special Purpose Vehicle incorporated in the ADGM serves as a passive holding vehicle without active operational management responsibilities, banking relationships, or operational infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The SPV's sole function is to hold legal title to the underlying property and issue digital tokens representing ownership interests to investors.</p>
        <p>The SPV structure is implemented through a three-tier hierarchy: the ADGM-incorporated SPV holds 100% of the shares of a Lebanese SARL (Société à Responsabilité Limitée), which in turn holds legal title to the physical property. This structure enables enforcement through the New York Convention while maintaining ADGM governance over the ownership structure.</p>

        <h3>Target Market and Investor Classification</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani serves the Lebanese diaspora through a single-track qualification system for Retail Clients. The qualification system is knowledge-based rather than wealth-exclusive. Rather than requiring all investors to demonstrate High-Net-Worth status, TLB permits retail participation subject to knowledge-based qualification requirements.</p>
        <p>Retail Clients access the platform through the PFP retail exemption, subject to a maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering and mandatory knowledge-based qualification through the Mastery Assessment. Retail Clients may invest at tiered minimum amounts in the mid-to-low five-figure USD range (specifically, USD 10,000 to USD 55,000 per asset).</p>
        
        <h3>Facilities Management Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The Facilities Management Company (FMC) serves as the operational arm of each property SPV, responsible for all day-to-day property management functions. The FMC enables the SPV structure to function as a passive holding vehicle while ensuring properties are actively maintained, tenants are managed, and revenues are collected.</p>
        <p><strong>Token Holder Governance Framework:</strong> TLB's role is strictly limited to platform administration and contractual enforcement. TLB does not exercise discretionary judgment over FMC performance matters. Instead, TLB uploads quarterly KPI results and monthly performance reports to the platform, where token holders review the data and vote on whether they are satisfied with FMC performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Automated Consequence Framework:</strong> The FMC Agreement incorporates automated penalty provisions that trigger when KPI thresholds are not met. These provisions are encoded in the contract and applied programmatically.</p>

        <h3>Payment Infrastructure and Non-Custodial Model</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates a strictly non-custodial model with respect to investor funds and property owner proceeds. All fund flows are processed through a UAE-licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) partner. The non-custodial model ensures that TLB never takes possession, control, or custody of investor funds at any stage.</p>
        <p><strong>System Architecture Verification:</strong> Token Lebnani will submit a third-party system architecture audit report with the formal application, confirming that the payment initiation interface is technically incapable of receiving or instructing the receipt of client funds until the smart contract validates both the expiration of the 48-hour cooling-off period and the client's final "proceed" instruction.</p>

        <h3>Compliance and AML/CFT Framework</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani maintains compliance infrastructure consistent with ADGM requirements. The AML/CFT Program is predicated on a risk-based approach that allocates resources in proportion to the assessed risk profile of customers, transactions, and geographic exposure.</p>
        <p>For customers connected to Lebanon, enhanced EDD procedures apply, including specific verification of the legitimacy of fund flows through the Lebanese banking system and specific attention to sanctions compliance given Lebanon's FATF grey-list status.</p>

        <h2>Document 3: Regulatory Analysis — Category 4 (Arranging) Framework</h2>
        
        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>This regulatory analysis demonstrates that Token Lebnani Ltd's proposed business model falls within the scope of the ADGM Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) Category 4 Financial Services Permission, specifically the regulated activity of "Arranging Deals in Investments."</p>

        <h3>Regulatory Framework Overview</h3>
        <p>The Abu Dhabi Global Market provides the regulatory jurisdiction for Token Lebnani's operations, with English Common Law principles governing commercial relationships and FSRA rules governing regulated activities.</p>

        <h3>Category 4 License Scope</h3>
        <p>The Category 4 license authorizes the regulated activity of "Arranging Deals in Investments," which enables Token Lebnani to facilitate primary market issuance of digital securities representing ownership in real estate assets located in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The Category 4 license scope is explicitly limited to arranging activities. Token Lebnani does not operate and is not authorized to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF), Exchange, or Custodian.</p>

        <h3>Arranging Activity Analysis</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani's primary market activities fall squarely within the arranging definition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Facilitation of Primary Market Issuance:</strong> Token Lebnani facilitates the issuance of digital securities by bringing together property owners seeking capital and investors seeking property ownership.</li>
            <li><strong>Matched Redemption for Retail Clients:</strong> For retail secondary market access, Token Lebnani operates a Matched Redemption mechanism. This mechanism does not involve the platform purchasing securities from its own account.</li>
            <li><strong>Investor Qualification and Onboarding:</strong> Token Lebnani operates a knowledge-based qualification system verifying that Retail Clients possess requisite understanding of the investment product.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Facilitation:</strong> All primary market transactions are executed through the VASP partner infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Private Financing Platform Framework</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani operates within the Private Financing Platform (PFP) framework applicable within the ADGM RegLab environment. Under the PFP retail exemption, Token Lebnani serves Retail Clients subject to: Maximum of 200 Retail Clients per asset offering; Mandatory knowledge-based qualification (Mastery Assessment); 48-Hour Cooling-Off Period; Self-Declaration Protocol.</p>

        <h3>Cross-Border Enforcement Framework</h3>
        <p>Arbitration awards issued in the ADGM are enforceable in Lebanon through the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958). The Arbitrator shall be explicitly empowered to issue awards denominated in US Dollars and to mandate that any payment be made in fresh US Dollars to a designated account outside of Lebanon.</p>

        <h3>AML/CFT Regulatory Compliance & ELR</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani Limited maintains an Enforcement Litigation Reserve (ELR) in compliance with GEN Principle 6. The ELR is structured as a phased funding model. Day 1 Minimum: USD 300,000. Target Ratio: 4% of Total Client Assets Under Arrangement. The full reserve will reach USD 575,000 within 36 months.</p>

        <h3>Base Capital Requirement</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani Limited maintains a Base Capital of USD 10,000, satisfying the minimum requirement for Category 4 Authorised Persons under ADGM Prudential Rulebook (PRU) 3.4.1(1)(a). This capital level applies because Token Lebnani does not hold Client Money as defined under COBS Rule 11.2.</p>

    <div id="governance" class="dossier-section">
        <h2>Governance Hierarchy and Control Framework</h2>

        <h3>Governance Structure Overview</h3>
        <p>TLB operates under a governance structure designed to ensure clear accountability, appropriate oversight, and effective risk management. The structure reflects the three-tier legal architecture, with distinct governance mechanisms for each layer.</p>

        <h3>Board of Directors</h3>
        <p>The Board of Directors holds ultimate responsibility for the firm's strategy, risk appetite, and governance. The Board maintains distinct committees including Audit, Risk, and Compliance committees.</p>

        <h3>Three Lines of Defense Model</h3>
        <p><strong>First Line (Business Operations):</strong> Own and manage inherent risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Second Line (Compliance & Risk):</strong> Independent oversight and policy design.</p>
        <p><strong>Third Line (Internal Audit):</strong> Independent assurance on control framework effectiveness.</p>

        <h3>The "Triple-Lock" Binding Mechanism</h3>
        <p>The ADGM SPV's control is secured by three mechanisms:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Registered Share Pledge:</strong> Registered share pledge at Lebanese Commercial Register provides security for investors.</li>
            <li><strong>Management Services Agreement:</strong> Establishes control mechanisms and service standards.</li>
            <li><strong>ADGM-Seated Arbitration Clause:</strong> Enables dispute resolution within the ADGM framework.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Control Framework</h3>
        <p>Includes financial controls (segregation of duties, daily reconciliation), operational controls (access controls, business continuity), and compliance controls (AML/CFT policies, transaction monitoring).</p>
    </div>

    <div id="poc" class="dossier-section">
        <h2>Proof of Concept (POC) Technical Brief</h2>

        <h3>Core Infrastructure: ERC-1400 Standard</h3>
        <p>Tokens issued through the platform are Digital Securities under ADGM law, representing direct ownership interests in the underlying property SPV. The platform issues tokens using ERC-1400 or equivalent standards suitable for regulated securities.</p>

        <h3>Non-Custodial Model</h3>
        <p>TLB operates a strictly non-custodial model. Investors connect via WalletConnect; TLB never accesses private keys. The non-custodial model ensures that TLB never takes possession, control, or custody of investor funds.</p>

        <h3>FRT Routing Clarification</h3>
        <p>Dividend distributions utilize "Accepted FRTs" (Fiat-Referenced Tokens). The smart contract acts as a technology router, facilitating the direct transfer of FRTs from the Project SPV's segregated reserve account to the investor's verified wallet. TLB never takes possession or control of the FRTs.</p>
        <p><strong>Hard-Coded Destination Controls:</strong> The dividend distribution smart contract is deployed with strictly limited destination parameters. Funds can only be routed to Whitelisted Investor Wallets or the SPV Reserve Account.</p>
        <p><strong>Multi-Sig Administrative Governance:</strong> Administrative control over smart contract upgrades requires a three-party quorum signature (TLB, VASP Partner, Standby Servicer).</p>

        <h3>Audit Commitment</h3>
        <p>Commitment to annual third-party security audits of production tokenization smart contracts.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="wind-down" class="dossier-section">
        <h2>Resolution and Cessation (Wind-Down) Plan</h2>

        <h3>Resolution Framework</h3>
        <p>The platform maintains a comprehensive resolution framework designed to ensure orderly cessation of operations while protecting investor interests. The framework addresses potential wind-down scenarios ranging from strategic business cessation to regulatory intervention.</p>

        <h3>The "Standby Servicer" Model</h3>
        <p>Upon determination that wind-down is required, a pre-contracted ADGM-licensed Corporate Service Provider (CSP) assumes administrative duties of the Project SPVs. This Standby Servicer arrangement ensures that SPV administration continues uninterrupted.</p>
        
        <h3>Standby Servicer Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Corporate records and filings:</strong> Maintaining SPV statutory registers.</li>
            <li><strong>Property management continuity:</strong> Coordinating with the incumbent FMC.</li>
            <li><strong>Distribution management:</strong> Processing investor distributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory liaison:</strong> Coordinating with the FSRA.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>FMC Continuity During Wind-Down</h3>
        <p>The physical asset management function remains with the incumbent third-party Facilities Management company under a long-term, survival-based contract. The Standby Servicer holds step-in rights that permit immediate replacement of the FMC upon evidence of insolvency or breach.</p>

        <h3>Orderly 6-Month Wind-Down</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani maintains a Wind-Down Reserve of USD 100,000. The wind-down process is divided into four distinct phases:</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 1 — Immediate Response (Days 1-7):</strong> Notification to FSRA, activation of Standby Servicer, investor communication.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 2 — Asset and Record Preservation (Days 8-30):</strong> Securing records, updating asset valuations, verifying investor registers.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 3 — Distribution and Cessation (Days 31-90):</strong> Calculating final distributions, liquidating remaining assets, regulatory approvals.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 4 — Dissolution (Days 91-180):</strong> Legal termination of entities, final filings, archive records.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="suitability" class="dossier-section">
        <h2>Client Suitability Framework</h2>

        <h3>Retail Client Qualification System</h3>
        <p>Token Lebnani serves Retail Clients through a comprehensive qualification system designed to ensure that investors possess requisite understanding of the investment product. The qualification system is knowledge-based rather than wealth-exclusive.</p>

        <h3>Mastery Assessment Requirements</h3>
        <p>The Mastery Assessment is a comprehensive evaluation covering three primary domains:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Risk Recognition:</strong> Understanding property market risk, currency risk, jurisdictional risk, and liquidity risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Asset Structure Comprehension:</strong> Understanding SPV ownership structure, token mechanics, and investor rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Mechanics:</strong> Understanding investment process, distribution mechanism, and secondary market limitations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The assessment requires a minimum passing score of 80% and includes biometric verification. Red-flag questions result in automatic failure.</p>

        <h3>Self-Declaration Protocol</h3>
        <p>The Self-Declaration Protocol ensures that Retail Clients provide informed consent through plain language acknowledgment of risks. It includes Time Spent Tracking and Comprehension Checks.</p>

        <h3>48-Hour Cooling-Off Period</h3>
        <p>The 48-Hour Cooling-Off Period ensures considered decision-making by preventing immediate investment commitment after completing the Mastery Assessment. The client's account is placed in "Pending Investment" status for 48 hours.</p>

        <h3>Target Audience Profiles</h3>
        <p><strong>Legacy Investors:</strong> Diaspora investors seeking to maintain connection to Lebanon through property ownership, prioritizing stability.</p>
        <p><strong>Passive Beneficiaries:</strong> Investors seeking hands-free property exposure without the management responsibilities associated with direct property ownership.</p>
